# Overview

Star Wars Planets Charted **Clifton Ho**.

Application was built with Create React App.


To start the application:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

When you start the web page, you will see two tables of Star Wars Planets and a bar chart showing the population of each planet with option to click different attributes. This was graphed using React Chart.JS

The first table is a table that paginates based on the Swapi planets endpoint Everytime you click the `Next Page` button, it will retrieve the next ten planets. Pagination for the table (show 10 planets each page)

The second table is pagination for a table of the Star Wars planes when all the planets were fetched by the API. 

I did pagination both ways to show case both ways. Both tables are ordered alphabetically by the planet's name. 

Additional Features I would have added:

Able to sort columns in order by clicking.
